Lambda panda - lambda calculus programming language in Racket
====================================================
The goal of this racket module is to implement a lambda calculus interpreter in Racket.

Usage:
I recommend using [DrRacket], an IDE for writing code in Racket and running it.

Open `call-by-value-eval.rkt` in DrRacket.

Click `Run`.  When prompted, enter a lambda expression, such as `((Î»(x)x)y))`, and it should return you a value `y`.

----------
I owe lots to the works of:

- Matt Might who wrote a [great post] on implementing an interpreter based on lambda calculus.
- Chapter 5 of Ken Slonneger and Barry Kurtz's [Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages], a great introductory mathematical foundation to lambda calclus.
- Andrew Kuhnhausen and his series of [blog posts] about lamba calculus, which I first based my own implementation on.
