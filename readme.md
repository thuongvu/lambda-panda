Lambda panda - exploring lambda calculus with racket
====================================================
The goal of this racket module is to implement a lambda calculus evaluator in racket and explore various reduction strategies (so far I've done call by value).

I owe a ton to the works of:

Matt Might who wrote a [great post] on implementing an interpreter based on lambda calculus.
Chapter 5 of Ken Slonneger and Barry Kurtz's [Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages], a great introductory mathematical foundation to lambda calclus.
Andrew Kuhnhausen and his series of [blog posts] about lamba calculus, which I first based my own implementation on.
